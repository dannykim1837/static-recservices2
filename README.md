# Rec Services Time Mangement Application

## Goal
To create a time mangement application for BYU-I's Rec Services.

## GitHub Pages Link
### [Main Page (Put a link here)]()

## Current Status
MVP complete.

## To Do - GitHub Setup
- Add branch protection rules to prevent changes being commited directly to main (must make branches for each issue/task, then merge)
- Could also change pull request requirements (must have 2 members review work, only certain people can close, etc)

- ## Future Work
This project will also be worked on by future CSE397 students. Code and documentation for this project will be uploaded and updated within this repository.
