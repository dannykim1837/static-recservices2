| Contributor| Section assigned Task|
| --- | --- |
| Alex | Section 6 |

| Danny Kim | Section 2 |

## Tasks:

The following tasks should be completed in the project's repo not in the class repo, to ensure separation of tasking.

For each of the tasks, link the SDD files to the associated sections. (Note: when copied to the class's repo, students from other teams, will not be able to access based on access control, and that is ok.)
