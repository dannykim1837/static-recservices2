## Tasks

The following tasks should be completed in the project's repo, not in the class repo, to ensure separation of tasking.

For each of the tasks, link the Code files to the associated sections.  
(Note: when copied to the class's repo, students from other teams will not be able to access based on access control, and that is ok.)

- [x] Each code files create needs to be reviewed
- [x] Each code file that is modified needs to be reviewed
- [x] Each code file needs to be associated with a test
- [x] Each code file comforms to the team's coding standards

## Audit:
- [x] Review has been done on each story

## Additional Elicitation Elements not found in
If you find that a requirement or eliciation element is missing a cross reference, than as part of the review meeting add it to the meeting notes. And as an Action Item fix it. 
* Action Item 1: Add time tracking to database?
