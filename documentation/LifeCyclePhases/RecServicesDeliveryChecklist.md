## Tasks:
The following tasks should be completed in the project's repo not in the class repo, to ensure seperation of tasking.

For each of the tasks, link the VDD files to the assoicated sections. (Note: when copied to the class's repo, students from other teams, will not be able to access based on access control, and that is ok.)
