# RecServices Backend Team's VDD Checklist

## Contributor Table
List the names of the individuals who contributed to the VDD and what sections they completed.
| Contributor| Section assigned Task|
| --- | --- |
| Joseph Turgoose | Conducted team meetings, fixed shift ID auto-incrementation, connected employee data to shift creation and calendar, worked on documentation, bug fixes|
| Gage Smith | Worked on documentation, prepped Employee Dashboard file for implementation once the DB team enables authentication properly |
| Spencer Sowby | Reformatted file structure for React industry standard, separated layouts into components as necessary, set up new controller functions for reading from and updating tables in the database|
| Calvin Bullock | Implemented shift creation & display functionality, bug fixes |

## Tasks:
The following tasks should be completed in the project's repo not in the class repo, to ensure seperation of tasking.

For each of the tasks, link the VDD files to the assoicated sections. (Note: when copied to the class's repo, students from other teams, will not be able to access based on access control, and that is ok.)
