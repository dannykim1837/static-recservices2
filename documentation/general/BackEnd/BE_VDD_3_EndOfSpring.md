# Version Design Document 3 (End of Spring Semester)

* Version Number: 3
* Release Date: 07/21/2025
* Known Issues:
  * The database is set up for testing, so some security features (like account verification) may not work correctly until Supabase RLS is turned back on.
  * Waiting on database features necessary for events, notifications, and shift trade / time off requests.
  * UI bug seems to prevent us from testing both the mobile view and the desktop view - we can only see one view, which we believe is a variation of the mobile view.
