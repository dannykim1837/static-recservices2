# RecServices Backend Code Checklist

## Contributor Table
List the names of the individuals who contributed to the Code and what sections they completed.
| Contributor| Section assigned Task|
| --- | --- |
| Joseph Turgoose | Express files, Supabase connection, Employee table files, using Express in calendar.js, helped DB configure Express authentication, tested RLS BE configuration and prepared BE team for switch from Express, led team meetings, prepared and filled out BE documents  |
| Gage Smith | Position table files, using Express in userProfile.js, outlining tasks for RLS configuration when FE configures React |
| Calvin bullock | Shift table files, using Express in calendar.js, outlining tasks for RLS configuration when FE configures React |
| Spencer Sowby | Location table files, using Express in calendar.js, outlining tasks for RLS configuration when FE configures React |

## Tasks:
The following tasks should be completed in the project's repo not in the class repo, to ensure seperation of tasking.
For each of the tasks, link the Code files to the assoicated sections. (Note: when copied to the class's repo, students from other teams, will not be able to access based on access control, and that is ok.)

- Note: Since we are switching from Express and HTML to Supabase RLS and React, a large portion of this work is invalidated.  However, the work done by the BE and DB teams in the controller files will still help greatly for configuring files correctly in the future, and a connection between the DB, BE, and FE using RLS has already been made.

## Additional Elicitation Elements not found in
If you find that a requirement or eliciation element is missing a cross reference, than as part of the review meeting add it to the meeting notes. And as an Action Item fix it.
