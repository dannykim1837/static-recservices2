# Wireframes
## Description
Wireframes created for the project will be stored in this folder. Figma files can be viewed and worked on collaboratively [here](https://www.figma.com/design/h6BuhsLMqz7VcvrEzkbQKl/FE-Wireframes?node-id=41-2&p=f&t=myjcjeC7WhUfuFZb-0). Or by uploading the backup "FE Wireframes.fig" to Figma.com and creating a new workspace. [To Do for future semesters: Create new workspace and update link]

## Note
IT is up to the development team's preference if only .fig file is kept or screenshots are saved as well. Having backups is never a bad idea.

## Instructions
### GitHub Instructions
- Create a new branch to work on (based off of main)
- Download files to work on in Figma
- Upload changed files (must have the same name/location)
- Make a pull request to update main branch
- Add the pull request to your **GitHub issue** and mark as complete
