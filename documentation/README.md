# Documentation

## Folders
### Tasks
Contains tasks assigned initially assigned to Winter 2025. This includes Workflows for each page (Tasks/FE_Workflows), [TODO: Add description for other sub-folders].

### General
Contains folders for each team's documentation, such as research documents, planning notes, architecture references, or any other supporting materials.

### Wireframes
Contains png, .drawio, and .fig files that contain wireframes for various pages of the application. Wireframes for various screen sizes were created to ensure desktop and mobile views were considered. There is also a .fig document that acts as a backup for the Figma workspace being used by Winter 2025. By uploading the .fig file to Figma.com, the pages can be worked on and viewed by multiple teammates.

**NOTE** A more updated view of the wireframes is available [here](https://www.figma.com/design/h6BuhsLMqz7VcvrEzkbQKl/FE-Wireframes?node-id=41-3&p=f) at Winter 2025's current workspace.
[TODO: (upkeep between semesters): Update the GitHub's .fig copy in the GitHub at the end of semester]
