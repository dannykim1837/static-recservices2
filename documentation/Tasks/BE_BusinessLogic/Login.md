#### **Overview**
- Describe the purpose and expected functionality of this business logic.
- Example: "This module processes user authentication by verifying credentials against the database and generating a session token."

#### **Input Data & Sources**
- Define the required input data, including expected formats and sources (e.g., API request payloads, database queries, external integrations).

#### **Process & Workflow**
- Detail the step-by-step logic, including computations, validations, and business rules applied to the input data.

#### **Database & Data Handling**
- Define the database interactions (queries, stored procedures, caching, indexing, etc.).
- Specify data transformations and persistence logic.

#### **API Interactions**
- List necessary API calls, including request formats, expected responses, and error handling.

#### **Output & System Responses**
- Define the expected output, such as API responses, database updates, logs, or notifications.

#### **Edge Cases & Error Handling**
- Identify potential failure scenarios and the system's response (e.g., invalid inputs, service failures, concurrency issues).

#### **Dependencies**
- List required libraries, frameworks, external services, or integrations.

#### **Performance Considerations**
- Identify optimizations for efficiency, scalability, and security best practices.

#### **Testing Considerations**
- Outline unit tests, integration tests, and any necessary load or security testing strategies.
