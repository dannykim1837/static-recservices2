# Business Logic Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a structured approach to documenting back-end business logic. It ensures that all data processing, computations, and API interactions are properly documented for development and review.

## Public Repository - current backend code
https://github.com/myjoshem/recservices
We moved the code to a public repository so that it could be deployed on Render. Please clone the repository in another location before making any additional changes in upcoming semesters.

### **How to Use This Document**
- This serves as a reference for all back-end business logic tasks.
- Each logic flow should be documented using the structured template provided.
- The Group Leader should assign specific business logic tasks to their team members.
- Updates should be made as necessary to reflect changes in implementation or requirements.

---

## Task Assignments

### **Required Task Coverage**
Each assigned task should ensure documentation and implementation of the following three areas:
1. **Input**: Define what data is required, its format, and how it is received.
2. **Processing**: Describe the business logic, computations, or transformations performed on the input.
3. **Output**: Specify the expected results, stored data, or responses from the system.

### **Current Tasks**
- **Assign Schedule**: [Assign Name]
- **Assign Shift**: [Assign Name]
- **Clock In & Clock Out**: [Assign Name]
- **Login**: [Assign Name]
- **User Account**: [Assign Name]

## Business Logic Documentation Template

### **Feature Name**

#### **Overview**
- Describe the purpose and expected functionality of the business logic.
- Example: "The authentication service verifies user credentials and issues secure access tokens."

#### **Input Data**
- Define the required input parameters and expected data formats.
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
  }
  ```

#### **Processing & Workflow**
- Outline step-by-step data processing and logic execution.
- Example breakdown:
  1. Validate input parameters.
  2. Query the database for user credentials.
  3. Verify password hash.
  4. Generate and return authentication token.

#### **Database Interactions**
- Define necessary database operations.
- Example:
  - **Query:** Retrieve user by username
  - **Update:** Store session token
  - **Delete:** Expire old sessions

#### **API Endpoints & Responses**
- Define the API interactions required for this business logic.
- Example:
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/login`
  - **Request Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "username": "user123",
      "password": "securePass"
    }
    ```
  - **Response Handling:**
    - Success: Return authentication token.
    - Failure: Return error message.

#### **Output & Data Storage**
- Define how the processed data is stored or returned.
- Example:
  - Authentication success: Return JWT token.
  - Authentication failure: Log attempt and return error response.

#### **Edge Cases & Error Handling**
- Identify potential failure points and system responses.
- Example:
  - **Incorrect credentials:** Return authentication failure.
  - **Database timeout:** Retry query or return error response.
  - **Expired session:** Force user re-authentication.

#### **Dependencies**
- List required libraries, frameworks, and services.
- Example:
  - **Node.js/Express** for API handling.
  - **knex** module for easy change and migration tasks for database management and configuration
  - **MySQL** for database management.
  - **Supabase** for authentication.

#### **Testing Considerations**
- Define necessary testing strategies.
  - Unit tests for function correctness.
  - Integration tests for database and API interaction.
  - Load testing for performance evaluation.

## Notes
- Ensure compliance with security best practices.
- Optimize queries and processes for performance.
- Update this documentation as the project evolves.

*This document should be maintained and updated regularly as business logic evolves and scales.*
